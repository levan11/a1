Project Structure: Create a Solution:

Create a new .NET solution named "WebApiSolution."

Class Libraries: Create the following class libraries within the solution: Domain: Define two model classes (Product and Category). Data: Implement a DbContext class (AppDbContext) and manage database migrations. Services: Create a service class (ProductService) responsible for business logic related to products.

Web API Project: Create a Web API project named "WebApiApp." Set up appsettings.json with a connection string for the database.

Controller: Implement a controller (ProductsController) in the Web API project. Use dependency injection to inject the ProductService into the controller.

Create API endpoints for: Retrieving all products. Retrieving a single product by ID. Adding a new product. Updating an existing product. Deleting a product. Retrieving all products in a specific category. Retrieving the total price of products in a specific category. Retrieving the total price of products per category.

Database Integration: Configure Entity Framework Core in the Web API project to use the AppDbContext.

Models: Implement the Product and Category models in the Domain class library.

Product Domain Class:

Id: Type: Integer Description: Unique identifier for the product.

Name: Type: String Description: Name of the product.

Price: Type: Decimal Description: Price of the product.

CategoryId: Type: Integer Description: Identifier indicating the category to which the product belongs.

Additional Properties (Optional): Description, CreatedAt, or any other properties that might be relevant to your application.

Category Domain Class:

Id: Type: Integer Description: Unique identifier for the category.

Name: Type: String Description: Name of the category.

Additional Properties (Optional): Description, CreatedAt, or any other properties that might be relevant to your application.

DbContext: Create the AppDbContext class in the Data class library, inheriting from DbContext. Include DbSet properties for both Product and Category.

Services: Implement the ProductService class in the Services class library. Include methods for CRUD operations on products.

Controller Actions: Implement actions in the ProductsController to interact with the ProductService. Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each action.

Dependency Injection: Inject the ProductService into the ProductsController using constructor injection.

Testing: Use a tool like Postman or Swagger to test the API endpoints. Test each endpoint for various scenarios, especially those involving the enhanced service logic.

Documentation: Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of each class and method. Include XML comments for the API endpoints in the controller.

Note: For the endpoints that accept parameters (e.g., category ID), ensure proper validation and error handling. Implement error responses with meaningful messages and appropriate HTTP status codes. Use asynchronous programming where appropriate, especially for database operations to improve scalability.
